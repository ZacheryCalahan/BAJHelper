# Bytes and Joysticks Discord Bot

## What is this?
This is a discord bot that is coded in Java that shows off the basics of a Command Manager system and a role selection system.
The bot logs no information, and is extensible.

## Getting Started
In order to use this bot, it will require a token from your bot. 
This token is a System Enviroment Variable with the name *BAJ_TOKEN*.

### Permissions and Scope
While coding this bot, the permissions are all allowed. Further in the future,
the permissions will be culled to only allow needed permissions.

The used scopes are as follows:
    ```
    application.commands
    ```
    ```
    bot
    ```
